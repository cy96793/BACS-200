                    <p class="lead">Air Jordan is a brand of basketball sneakers, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by Nike. It was created after 6x NBA champion and finals MVP, 5x NBA Most Valuable Player, 14x NBA All-Star, Michael Jordan. The original Air Jordan sneakers were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in early 1984 and released to the public in late 1984. The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The most iconic Air Jordan sneaker is the Air Jordan 1 which was created and designed for Michael Jordan in 1984. The Air Jordan 1 made it depute to the public for only $65 dollars. As of 2020 the Air Jordan line reached number 34 and is being well represented by young NBA players like Zion Williamson and Jason Tatum. The typical Air Jordan retail price today is around $200 dollars. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Listed below is what Air Jordan sneaker Michael Jordan wore during his six championship runs. </p>
                    <ol class="lead">1. 1990-91 NBA Champion â Air Jordan 6</ol>
                    <ol class="lead">2. 1991-92 NBA Champion â Air Jordan 7</ol>
                    <ol class="lead">3. 1992-93 NBA Champion - Air Jordan 8</ol>

                    <ol class="lead">6. 1997-98 NBA Champion â Air Jordan 13</ol>
                    <p class="lead">Air Jordanâs are one of the worldâs most known sneakers. The resell value of certain Air Jordanâs are at itâs all time high. âHypedâ Air Jordanâs can be worth up to couple thousands of dollars! So, if you got some original Air Jordan sneakers collecting dust in the basement donât give them away! Sell them on the resell market and earn some serious cash. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Pictured on the left is the orginal "Chicago" Air Jordan 1 from 1984. The current market price is around $2,500</p>

                    <p class="lead">Nike, Inc., formerly (1964â78) Blue Ribbon Sports, American sportswear company headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman a track-and-field coach at the University of Oregon, and his former student Phil Knight. They opened their first retail outlet in 1966 and launched the Nike brand shoe in 1972. The company was renamed Nike, Inc., in 1978 and went public two years later. By the early 21st century, Nike had retail outlets and distributors in more than 170 countries, and its logoâa curved check mark called the âswooshââwas recognized throughout the world.</p>
                    <p class="lead">In 1970, Bowerman was experimenting by pouring rubber into his wifeâs waffle iron and he created the waffle sole. Since then the waffle sole is an innovation that changed running shoes forever. Also, in 1972, Nike released the Cortez during the Mexico Olympics. The Cortez was a culmination of Nikeâs track shoe development and the first to feature foam for cushioning. The Cortez is one of the most iconic sneakers for Nike and has been released in many different colorways throughout the years. One of the most popular color ways is the âForrest Gumpâ made for the movie. Other really iconic and popular silhouette today are the Blazers and any Air Max sneakers. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Personally, my favorite Nike sneakers are the Air Max 97 and Air Max 90. I just love the style they bring and how comfortable they are at the same time. It is crazy to me that the Air Max 90 came out 30 years ago and it still very popular lifestyle sneaker! </p>
                    <p class="lead">Pictured on the right is the Nike Air Max 97 "Silver Bullet". The current market price is around $350</p>

                    <p class="lead">Kanye West. One of the most iconic music geniuses of the past couple decades. Being the brilliant man Kanye is, he decided to get into the sneaker industry. He was with Nike for a bit and after a fallout he joined Adidas for a 10-million-dollar contract plus royalties. Since then Yeezy was born.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The Adidas Yeezy Boost was introduced in 2015 and hasnât stopped selling since. These sneakers have become been so popular that new drops typically sell out in under a minute. The Adidas Yeezy shoes come in 4 styles â the Yeezy Boost 750, Yeezy Boost 350, Yeezy Boost 350 v2, and the Yeezy Boost 950. And at the end of 2017, the Yeezy 700 saw the day of light.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The Yeezy Boost 750, the first Yeezy to ever drop from Adidas, was proudly inspired by an Australian shoe design. Kanye West had hopes of creating the sneakers of the future and referred to himself as âthe most influential person in footwear.â They were modeled after Uggâs and styled for Marty McFly. With style like that, it looks like the future is going to be pretty dope.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Yeezyâs are the most hype sneakers released across the world. People stay up all night at their computer screens and camp out in front of sneaker stores. People act like zombies for these shoes, and the craze is contagious. The trend began in February 2015 when the first Yeezy Boost 750 was released. Kim Kardashian tweeted about their success, and Kanye made history by basically breaking the internet.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The resell market is crazy expensive for Yeezyâs. If someone secures a hyped pair of Yeezyâs they could make around $500-$1000 dollars profit. One of the most iconic Yeezyâs every dropped is the Air Yeezy II Red Octobers! The average sale price of Red Octobers is little over 8 thousand right now. Couple years ago, they were going for over 10 thousand. Isnât that crazy?</p>

                    <p class="lead">Nike, Inc., formerly (1964â78) Blue Ribbon Sports, American sportswear company headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman a track-and-field coach at the University of Oregon, and his former student Phil Knight. They opened their first retail outlet in 1966 and launched the Nike brand shoe in 1972. The company was renamed Nike, Inc., in 1978 and went public two years later. By the early 21st century, Nike had retail outlets and distributors in more than 170 countries, and its logoâa curved check mark called the âswooshââwas recognized throughout the world.</p>
                    <p class="lead">In 1970, Bowerman was experimenting by pouring rubber into his wifeâs waffle iron and he created the waffle sole. Since then the waffle sole is an innovation that changed running shoes forever. Also, in 1972, Nike released the Cortez during the Mexico Olympics. The Cortez was a culmination of Nikeâs track shoe development and the first to feature foam for cushioning. The Cortez is one of the most iconic sneakers for Nike and has been released in many different colorways throughout the years. One of the most popular color ways is the âForrest Gumpâ made for the movie. Other really iconic and popular silhouette today are the Blazers and any Air Max sneakers. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Personally, my favorite Nike sneakers are the Air Max 97 and Air Max 90. I just love the style they bring and how comfortable they are at the same time. It is crazy to me that the Air Max 90 came out 30 years ago and it still very popular lifestyle sneaker! </p>
                    <p class="lead">Pictured on the right is the Nike Air Max 97 "Silver Bullet". The current market price is around $350</p>

                    <p class="lead">Air Jordan is a brand of basketball sneakers, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by Nike. It was created after 6x NBA champion and finals MVP, 5x NBA Most Valuable Player, 14x NBA All-Star, Michael Jordan. The original Air Jordan sneakers were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in early 1984 and released to the public in late 1984. The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The most iconic Air Jordan sneaker is the Air Jordan 1 which was created and designed for Michael Jordan in 1984. The Air Jordan 1 made it depute to the public for only $65 dollars. As of 2020 the Air Jordan line reached number 34 and is being well represented by young NBA players like Zion Williamson and Jason Tatum. The typical Air Jordan retail price today is around $200 dollars. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Listed below is what Air Jordan sneaker Michael Jordan wore during his six championship runs. </p>
                    <ol class="lead">1. 1990-91 NBA Champion â Air Jordan 6</ol>

                    <p class="lead">Air Jordanâs are one of the worldâs most known sneakers. The resell value of certain Air Jordanâs are at itâs all time high. âHypedâ Air Jordanâs can be worth up to couple thousands of dollars! So, if you got some original Air Jordan sneakers collecting dust in the basement donât give them away! Sell them on the resell market and earn some serious cash. </p>
