                    <p class="lead">Air Jordan is a brand of basketball sneakers, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by Nike. It was created after 6x NBA champion and finals MVP, 5x NBA Most Valuable Player, 14x NBA All-Star, Michael Jordan. The original Air Jordan sneakers were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in early 1984 and released to the public in late 1984. The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The most iconic Air Jordan sneaker is the Air Jordan 1 which was created and designed for Michael Jordan in 1984. The Air Jordan 1 made it depute to the public for only $65 dollars. As of 2020 the Air Jordan line reached number 34 and is being well represented by young NBA players like Zion Williamson and Jason Tatum. The typical Air Jordan retail price today is around $200 dollars. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Listed below is what Air Jordan sneaker Michael Jordan wore during his six championship runs. </p>

                    <p class="lead">Nike, Inc., formerly (1964â78) Blue Ribbon Sports, American sportswear company headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman a track-and-field coach at the University of Oregon, and his former student Phil Knight. They opened their first retail outlet in 1966 and launched the Nike brand shoe in 1972. The company was renamed Nike, Inc., in 1978 and went public two years later. By the early 21st century, Nike had retail outlets and distributors in more than 170 countries, and its logoâa curved check mark called the âswooshââwas recognized throughout the world.</p>
                    <p class="lead">In 1970, Bowerman was experimenting by pouring rubber into his wifeâs waffle iron and he created the waffle sole. Since then the waffle sole is an innovation that changed running shoes forever. Also, in 1972, Nike released the Cortez during the Mexico Olympics. The Cortez was a culmination of Nikeâs track shoe development and the first to feature foam for cushioning. The Cortez is one of the most iconic sneakers for Nike and has been released in many different colorways throughout the years. One of the most popular color ways is the âForrest Gumpâ made for the movie. Other really iconic and popular silhouette today are the Blazers and any Air Max sneakers. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Personally, my favorite Nike sneakers are the Air Max 97 and Air Max 90. I just love the style they bring and how comfortable they are at the same time. It is crazy to me that the Air Max 90 came out 30 years ago and it still very popular lifestyle sneaker! </p>

                    <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="yeezy">Yeezy <span class="text-muted">2015</span></h2>
                    <p class="lead">Kanye West. One of the most iconic music geniuses of the past couple decades. Being the brilliant man Kanye is, he decided to get into the sneaker industry. He was with Nike for a bit and after a fallout he joined Adidas for a 10-million-dollar contract plus royalties. Since then Yeezy was born.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The Adidas Yeezy Boost was introduced in 2015 and hasnât stopped selling since. These sneakers have become been so popular that new drops typically sell out in under a minute. The Adidas Yeezy shoes come in 4 styles â the Yeezy Boost 750, Yeezy Boost 350, Yeezy Boost 350 v2, and the Yeezy Boost 950. And at the end of 2017, the Yeezy 700 saw the day of light.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The Yeezy Boost 750, the first Yeezy to ever drop from Adidas, was proudly inspired by an Australian shoe design. Kanye West had hopes of creating the sneakers of the future and referred to himself as âthe most influential person in footwear.â They were modeled after Uggâs and styled for Marty McFly. With style like that, it looks like the future is going to be pretty dope.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Yeezyâs are the most hype sneakers released across the world. People stay up all night at their computer screens and camp out in front of sneaker stores. People act like zombies for these shoes, and the craze is contagious. The trend began in February 2015 when the first Yeezy Boost 750 was released. Kim Kardashian tweeted about their success, and Kanye made history by basically breaking the internet.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The resell market is crazy expensive for Yeezyâs. If someone secures a hyped pair of Yeezyâs they could make around $500-$1000 dollars profit. One of the most iconic Yeezyâs every dropped is the Air Yeezy II Red Octobers! The average sale price of Red Octobers is little over 8 thousand right now. Couple years ago, they were going for over 10 thousand. Isnât that crazy?</p>

                    <p class="lead">To be exact, Puma was established in 1948, and the first shoe to release was the Atom a soccer shoe. In 1952 runner Josef Barthel wore Puma while he won a Olympic Gold Medal in the 1500 m. In 1956, the formstripe was introduced and since then, has been a Puma trademark. It wasnât till 1968 when Puma brought the now famous âPumaâ aka Cat logo to the sneakers.</p>
                    <p class="lead">1968 was a very controversial year for the African American communities and the Olympics. Tommie Smith, who won the Olympic Gold 200 m in Mexico was wearing a pair of Puma running shoes. He then took stand barefoot with the Pumaâs by his side. At this time, teammate John Carlos and Tommie Smith made the Black Power salute, because of the mistreatment of African Americans at the moment. Mr. Smith then left his pair of Pumaâs for the world to see. Later, both Olympians were banned from the Olympics.</p>
                    <p class="lead">In 1968 the Puma Clyde released, which is a basketball shoe designed by Walter âClydeâ Frazier, which today is one of the more popular Pumaâs. Other professional athletes to wear Puma are Diego Maradona, a professional soccer player and tennis superstar Boris Becker, which he had his own signature sneaker the âPuma Beckerâ and âPuma Becker Aceâ, releasing in the 1980s. </p>

                    <h2 class="featurette-heading" id="reebok">Reebok <span class="text-muted">1958</span></h2>
                    <p class="lead">Reebok was founded in England, in 1958, by a pair of brothers, Joe and Jeff Foster, to carry on a family tradition of making athletic footwear. Their grandfather, Joseph William Foster, had launched an eponymous company, J.W. Foster, in 1895 and developed one of the very first track spikes.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The family wanted to call the brand âMercuryâ but due to copy right issues they could not. Therefore, the brothers turned to the Grey Rhebok, a species of African Antelope, which inspired the brand name. Reebok continued to produce running spikes throughout the â60s and â70s, with the companyâs base remaining in England. In 1979, Reebok was exhibiting at the Chicago International Sneaker Trade Show, when Paul Fireman, an American outdoors gear wholesaler, discovered the brand; Fireman acquired the exclusive rights to Reebok in North America.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Throughout the years Reebok worked with a lot of professional athletes and entertainers such as Jay Z, Alicia Keys, Tyga, Swiss Beats, Shaq, Shawn Kemp, Floyd Mayweather and probably the most popular athlete with Reebok, Allen Iverson. Allen Iverson had many signature sneakers throughout his NBA career. During his rookie campaign he wore the Reebok Questions which is a very iconic sneaker today. After that, he wore the Reebok Answer. Allen Iverson had a new model for every season, so the Answerâs go from 1-12. </p>
                    <p class="lead">The famous Allen Iverson crossover of Michael Jordan will never be forgotten. The sneaker Iverson was wearing was the Reebok Questions âBlue Toeâ. That is part of the reason why I believe the Questions are one of the most popular Reebok basketball sneakers!</p>

                    <p class="lead">Brothers Paul Van Doren and Jim Van Doren along with partners Gordon Lee and Serge Delia open for business at 704 E. Broadway in Anaheim, Calif. on March 16, 1966. The Van Doren Rubber Company is unique in that it manufactures shoes on premises and sells them directly to the public. On that day, 12 people ordered sneakers and were ready to be picked up later that afternoon. </p>
                    <p class="lead">In 1976, the Vans #95, now known as the Era, with a padded collar and different color combinations, is designed by Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta and becomes the shoe of choice for a generation of skateboarders. In 1977, the Vans #36, the Old Skool, debuts with the now famous Vans Sidestripe and the the Vans #98 is also introduced and with the help of skateboarders and BMX riders, Vans Classic Slip-Ons become the rage in Southern California and will come to be the original Slip-On silhouette that will be known as an icon for generations.</p>
                    <p class="lead">By the end of the 1970âs Vans has 70 stores in California that shipped sneakers around the world. They continued to create classic silhouette like the Sk8-HI. Vans created the culture for skateboarding sneakers and offered them at a reasonable price so everyone could afford them. Today, you can see vans at any sneaker store in the mall and could buy a pair for around $60 dollars. </p>
