    <p>Speaker Notes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anything made outside the United States must be shipped via shipping barge or air freight</li>
        <li>A 2000lb box from China to NY cost around $4000 by shipping barge</li>
        <li>A 2000lb box from China to NY cost around $1200 by air freight</li>
        <li>Randy Brigs example from Otterbox about HP cameras</li>
        <li>Took around 6 weeks to get the cameras from China to the US</li>
        <li>Retailors didn't want to pay full price for the cameras because new technolgy has been developed within those 6 weeks</li>
        <li>Therefore, his company decided ditch shipping barges and put everything on air freight</li>
        <li>Even though it was more expensive, it insured the cameras got to the US in time and retailors pay full price</li>
    </ul>  
   
    <p>Overview Summary</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transportation is a very important aspect in the world of pricing. Many products Americans consume is made outside the United States and in result have to be shipped. On the business to business side of pricing many companies are expanding factories accross the globe. By having mutiple factories accross the globe reduces transportation cost and can lower MSRP pricing.</li>
