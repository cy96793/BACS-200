            If you are a fan of NBA basketball you know the name Russell Westbrook. Westbrook has spent 11 seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder and is now currently on the Huston Rockets. The 6'3 point guard is a moster on the court, stacking up ridiculous stats every night, and surving as a positive role model for kids in the community.

No matter what everyone know that Westbrook will give it his all and leave everything on the court. If a championship doesn't go Hustons way in 2020, they will have the whole summer to sharpen their skills and will have another shot in the 2020-2021 season. Go Rockets!
